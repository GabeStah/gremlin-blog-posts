## Prerequisites

- Creation and agreement on [Disaster Recovery and Dependency Failover Playbooks][#stage-1#prerequisites].
- Completion of [Resiliency Stage 1][#stage-1].
- Completion of [Resiliency Stage 2][#stage-2].
- Completion of [Resiliency Stage 3][#stage-3].
- Completion of [Resiliency Stage 4][#stage-4].

> Level 5 — Full automation
> All of level 4 requirements, plus
> Automated resiliency testing fully integrated into CI/CD environment
> Resiliency failure results in build failure
> Automated resiliency testing and DR failover testing enabled in production environment

> by the time you are at level five you are completely automated and literally the only support that someone in sre or SiteOps have to give you is a few hours of engineer time to ensure that the right buttons are clicked.
