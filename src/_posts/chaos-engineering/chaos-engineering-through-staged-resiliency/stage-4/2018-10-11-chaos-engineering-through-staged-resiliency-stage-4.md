## Introduction

## Resiliency Stage 4: 

> Level 4 — Automated — fully automated in pre-prod
> All of level 3 requirements, plus
> Automated resiliency testing in non-prod environment
> Semi-automated DR failover scripts (minimal human supervision required)

> level four increases the amount of automation.
